##Quick Recap
So far, I've used the Skater_Stats.Rmd R markdown file to summarise all of the stats for each player that appears on an NHL raw play-by-play file going back to 2007. Using the NST_Merge.Rmd R markdown file I was able to tidy up my player bio data found on Natural Stat Trick. My last step is to join these data sets and verify for accuracy. 

##Step 1: Join the Data
```{r Join Data}
require(plyr)
require(dplyr)

df.raw_join <- full_join(all_season_stats, final_player_bios, by = c("player" = "Player", "team" = "Team"))

head(df.raw_join, n = 10)

```
