## Background
Over the years a number of hockey minds such as [Denis Potvin](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/midseason-report/article1068323/?page=all) and [Bruce Boudreau](http://www.startribune.com/q-amp-a-with-wild-coach-bruce-boudreau/444222393/) have asserted that it takes around 300 games in the NHL for a player to accumulate enough experience to fully mature. Unfortunately for that player's NHL team, a significant amount of resources must be invested into giving a player almost 4 years to develop in an NHL program. 

Especially in the slary cap era, it's important for teams to allocate their resources as efficiently as possible. The opportunity costs of investment in Salary, Cap Space, Roster Spots, Ice Time on a player that doesn't pan out could have significant negative implications on a franchise's future. Based on [Alex Novet's conclusions](https://hockey-graphs.com/2017/03/14/strong-and-weak-links-talent-distribution-within-teams/), hockey appears to be a sport where the best players tend to impact a team's overall results quite a bit more than having a consistently strong depth team with less high-end talent. As a result, it would stand to reason that it is very important for teams to identify the high-end potential of their young players and invest in them rather than a player who's ceiling my not be much higher than replacement level. 

## Proposal

I believe that it is possible to estimate the potential ceiling of a player earlier than a player's 300th game. I intend to research how early we may be able to be comfortable with an estimate and to what level a team should we willing to invest roster space and ice time into said player to ensure that their assessment is correct. I suspect that players are currently investing too much in players that will likely only become depth-players.

###Definition of terms
* **Potential Ceiling:** To be further determined, however this refers to the the estimated on ice contribution of a player in future years. Possible systems of ranking could include the following:
    + [Game Score](https://hockey-graphs.com/2016/07/13/measuring-single-game-productivity-an-introduction-to-game-score/)
    + [Evolving Wild's GAR](https://hockeygraphsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gar_spm_ritsac_18.pdf)
    + [Corsica's WAR](http://corsica.hockey/war/)
    + Other Options?

* **Team Investment:** Also to be further determined. At a high level, refers to team resources admisistered to a player that results in an opportunity costs. Focus mainly on ice time, roster spots, etc. Some attention given to salary and cap space as well

* **Top-Tier Players:** Players drafted in the first or second round of their draft years

* **Lower-Tier Players:** Players drafted afte the second round of their draft years, or obtained via free agency

## Methodology
I think that this project will need to be approached in a number of phases:

1. Identify the data needed. More thoughts on this step below
2. Explore data sets. Review player performance throughout their career to understand the nature of "growth" of a player throughout their career. Common knowledge would suggest that a player's value increases from the time that they enter the league until they approach a certain age (somewhere around their 30s) at which point their production begins to taper off
3. Identify "Top Tier" players who have been in the league for 5+ years
4. Examine how top tier players are utilized on a team (time on ice, roster spots, lines, etc.). The goal is to identify how this utilization changes relative to performance. I would hypothesize that a team is more willing to invest resources in a younger player who's performance may not yet justify it in the hopes that the player will one day develop into a top tier performer. Is there an age level where that changes? When does a team appear to "give up" on a player's potential and begin reducing ice time of a player? 
4. Model development. Determine which metrics best predict future performance. A good starting point may be with a linear regression similar to an expected goals model?
5. Evaluate model and the preferable number of games that provides a large enough sample set to become confident in it's results. How does that number of games compare to actual league behavior? 
6. Utilize model to evaluate current young players in the NHL. Identify possible players who have strong potential to become a start as well as players who it may be time for teams to begin allocating resources elsewhere
